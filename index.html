			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>FJs 555 is an ongoing comprehensive research and analytics project centered around 
			the roles, functions, and specifications of the five best American fighter jets as well as 
			European, Soviet, and Asian fighters. We examine each fighter's specifications in relation to its 
			primary missions. We discuss general and detailed purposes of fighter jets, address the roles 
			Artificial Intelligence and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles like the Valkyrie drone. We continually investigate 
			new developments in modern programs such has Skyborg and Next Generation Air Dominance. We ensure that the 
			sources for our research and analysis are credible and recent. We strive to use military and renowned 
			manufacturer sites for as much information as we can. As we gather and analyze data, we structure and 
			organize our findings for future publication.</p>
